# AI rules (Claude / local LLM)

- Never assume the model is correct.
- For any “facts” (dates, standards codes, claims), prefer:
  - deriving from stored data, or
  - tagging as “suggested” and requiring review.
- When generating educational explanations:
  - step-by-step, student-friendly
  - include checks for common mistakes
  - include a short “why this works” conceptual note
