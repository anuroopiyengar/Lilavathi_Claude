You are a senior mobile product designer creating a Figma-ready UI kit for a math learning app called “Lilavati” (Bhāskarācārya’s Līlāvatī). Output must be structured, concise, and implementation-oriented.

Art direction:
- “Modern academic + warm heritage” (clean, contemporary; subtle geometric Indian-inspired motifs used sparingly)
- Avoid parchment/manuscript textures; keep modern and accessible.

Design system requirements:
- 8pt spacing grid, iOS + Android friendly
- AA contrast minimum, tap targets >=44px height
- Light mode first + dark mode for core screens
- Typography: readable sans for UI; optional serif accent only for verse titles
- Components must include states: default/pressed/disabled/error/success

Deliverable format:
1) Design Tokens (type scale, spacing, radii, elevation, icon style rules)
2) Color system (neutrals + 1 primary + 1 accent + semantic colors; include dark mode mapping)
3) Component Inventory (Figma naming + variants list)
4) 10 core components fully specified with variants:
   - Buttons (primary/secondary/tertiary)
   - Verse card (locked/in-progress/completed)
   - Tag chips (selected/unselected/disabled)
   - Progress ring + XP bar
   - Bottom navigation
   - Input field (normal/error/success)
   - Modal sheet
   - Empty state
   - Toast/snackbar
   - Loading skeleton

Do NOT write long explanations. Keep it Figma-execution ready.
