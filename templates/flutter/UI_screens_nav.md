Define the information architecture for Lilavati as a mobile app with 4-tab bottom nav:
1) Learn, 2) Practice, 3) Library, 4) Profile.

Output:
- Navigation map (tabs + key subroutes)
- 12–16 screen frames list with exact frame names (Figma-style)
- For each screen: purpose + primary actions + key components used
Constraints:
- Keep flows short and beginner-friendly
- Support “Verse → Understand → Solve → Practice → Mastery”
- Include Parent mode as a separate entry from Profile
